I run it a scheduled job to create a local database dump which I can then get off the hosting service and onto my backup system.\r\n\r\nThe script uses a configuration file for essential infomration (like where to put the backups).  In its simplest form it queries the database host for the list of database instances and makes a backup of each individually.\r\n\r\n## Help\r\n\r\n* The README.md file: https://github.com/DuncanFyfe/dbbackup/blob/master/README.md.\r\n* `perldoc dbbackup`\r\n* OR see the manual page.\r\n* `dbbackup.conf` file also has helpful comments.\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n    GPL-2","google":"UA-52004589-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
